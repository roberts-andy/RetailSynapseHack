# Challenge 3 - Ah-hoc Exploration

Awesome, so we have some data in the lake! Now What? Let's start by taking a look at the data and see what is there. You should see 6 files: 
* RetailCustomer.csv
* RetailProducts.csv
* RetailStores.csv
* RetailTransactionDetails.csv
* RetailTransactionHeader.csv
* RetailVisitorCount.csv

## Challenge Objectives

Let's try and answer these three questions: 
* How many rows are in each of the files? 
* How many transactions per month are there in the header file? 
* How are the top 10 customers in the dataset baeed on total amount spent? 

## Note
There are several ways to approach this problem. Try one or several approaches. When you speak to your coach to show your results you should be able to explain why you chose a given approach. Note - you don't need to answer every question with each approach you try.

> Hint: Navigate to your files in the data hub and right-click on a file!
