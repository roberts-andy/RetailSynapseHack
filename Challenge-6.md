# Challenge 6 - Create Initial Report
Fantastic job! You now have data in the data warehouse. Reporting teams are fired up and ready to start looking at the data. They need a little help though to get started with this new data source. Your job here is to create a Power BI report that connects to your new relational store that shows some basic elements that you can use to explain to the reporting community how to connect to the data warehouse. Something you might want to answer might be "what are total sales by state by month?" 

## Challenge Objectives

At the end of the challenge you should have a Power BI Desktop file that you can share with your coach. Walk through how you connected to data. Did you use import, direct query or hybrid mode and why? 

> hint: here is an example of a quick and dirty power bi report: [sample report](./basic_report.pbix)
